    "We will be examining metro and/or bus ridership in the cities of New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia and then seeing how these satisitcs relate to the population and CO2 emissions of each city. The specific ridership statistics for each city vary because the data available for each city was not exactly the same. However, by cleaning and cutting the data to fit our needs and then using plots and other statistics, we should be able to discover some interesting trends. \n"
