    "Why was this dataset created?:\n",

    "What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?:\n",
    "The user attributed their source to be the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics which we can hopefully assume is quite comprehensive and thorough. Therefore, it seems this dataset is should be representative and whole unless they somehow collected it wrong. \n",

    "If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?:\n",
    "This data has nothing to do with any specific individuals. It is CPI data that the Kaggle owner, Gajare, attributes to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics whose function it is to make this data available, so they likely expected and hoped for their data to be used in projects like this. \n",

    "**DATA LIMITATIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Validity of the data: This concern applies to both the wage data and inflation data, but more so to the wage data, because we know the inflation data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is quite reputable. However, we don't know much about Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America Data Library. At first glance the data appears valid, and we have no outstanding reason to assume it's not, so this isn't a huge concern. But it is something to think about because if there is invalid data then it could throw off the relationships we found and mean our findings are flawed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing relevant data: It's very possible, almost certain in fact, that we are missing some relevant inputs. There are so many things that likely affect GDP. Industry statistics, political atmosphere, crime rates, urban vs. rural population, etc. there are an infinite number of statistics that go into looking at GDP, and here we're looking at just a few. Our data is limited, by nature of the fact that it does not represent everything. That means we have to be careful about taking our findings as fact, because there's a lot of other factors in play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Limited time frame: 1973-2021 is a reasonably long timespan, but it also misses a lot of events in American history. We just couldn't find data going that far back, so we worked with what we found. But it's something to consider. "

    "We spoke to Professor K. about this a few days ago and we mentioned how we had to pivot ideas last minute. So, she said to include some details on our initial project idea and why we had to pivot. \n",
    "\n",
    "So initially, we were trying to collect public transit ridership data from different cities and then see how that correlated to CO2 emissions in those places. \n",

    "https://data-septa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SEPTA::average-daily-ridership-by-mode/explore\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we had to pivot is because the data just wasn't there. The emissions data was weak and unstandardized. Same issue with the ridership data. There wasn't enough data, the time frames weren't aligned, etc. Just a lot of foundational issues that couldn't be fixed with mere cleaning. \n",
