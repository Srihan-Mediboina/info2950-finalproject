    "Validity of the data: This concern applies to both the wage data and inflation data, but more so to the wage data, because we know the inflation data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is quite reputable. However, we don't know much about Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America Data Library. At first glance the data appears valid, and we have no outstanding reason to assume it's not, so this isn't a huge concern. But it is something to think about because if there is invalid data then it could throw off the relationships we found and mean our findings are flawed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing relevant data: It's very possible, almost certain in fact, that we are missing some relevant inputs. There are so many things that likely affect GDP. Industry statistics, political atmosphere, crime rates, urban vs. rural population, etc. there are an infinite number of statistics that go into looking at GDP, and here we're looking at just a few. Our data is limited, by nature of the fact that it does not represent everything. That means we have to be careful about taking our findings as fact, because there's a lot of other factors in play. \n",

    "Limited time frame: 1973-2021 is a reasonably long timespan, but it also misses a lot of events in American history. We just couldn't find data going that far back, so we worked with what we found. But it's something to consider. "
